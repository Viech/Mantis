# Mantis
This is the IRC bot found in the #unvanquished(-dev) channels on Freenode.

## Disclaimer
**I wrote this as a personal program.** It wasn't meant to be released to the public and may not follow the engineering principles that I would have applied if it was; In some regards it's more like a specialized script than a modular program. I open-sourced it on request and I don't plan on maintaining it beyond fixing critical bugs or making the changes that I need personally. It is also one of my earlier C++ programs so the code may look a lot like C and make bad use of C++' features.
